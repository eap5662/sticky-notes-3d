## Quick Answers

**Q: Why is camera yaw always ~90¬∞?**
A: The desk's forward vector points in -X direction. Camera is positioned opposite (in front of desk where user sits), which places it on +X axis = 90¬∞ yaw. See "Desk-Relative Camera Alignment" in technical guide.

**Q: Why does screen view have full 360¬∞ yaw?**
A: It doesn't‚Äîit has *dynamic* ¬±30¬∞ clamps centered around the calculated monitor-facing direction. The static config shows full range because clamps are applied dynamically in `CameraRigController`. See "Dynamic Clamp System" in technical guide.

**Q: What's the difference between yaw and azimuth?**
A: They're the same thing. "Yaw" is used in our code, "azimuth" is used by the `camera-controls` library. Both mean horizontal rotation angle around the Y-axis.

**Q: Why can't I just set yaw to 0¬∞ to align with desk?**
A: Because yaw is calculated from the desk's forward vector, which varies based on desk rotation. The calculation *produces* the correct yaw (typically 90¬∞ for standard desk orientation). Setting a fixed yaw wouldn't follow desk rotation. See "Desk-Relative Camera Alignment" in technical guide.
